**Corteza server Corredor** is an automation script **runner and bundler**.
It loads and processes provided automation scripts and serves them to the Corteza server backend.

Corteza Corredor and Corteza server communicate via gRPC with two services: server scripts with list and exec procedures; client scripts with list and bundle procedures.
See [protobuf service definition](https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-protobuf) for details.

Refer to the [Integrator Guide/Automation scripts](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/integrator-guide/automation/automation-scripts/index.html) for insight on how to work with automation scripts.

[Corteza Workflows](https://docs.cortezaproject.org/corteza-docs/2022.3/integrator-guide/automation/workflows/index.html) provide an alternative approach to automation by defining a flexible and intuitive simplified BPMN diagram editor.
