# Corteza Corredor

Corredor is an automation script runner.
It loads and processes scripts it has access and offers them to Corteza backend server on request.

It starts a gRPC server with 2 simple services:
 - Server scripts with list and exec procedures
 - Client scripts with list and bundle procedures

See https://github.com/cortezaproejct/corteza-protobuf[protobuf service definition] for details.

Corredor loads and monitors user scripts in the configured location

## Server scripts

These scripts are executed by Corredor directly or indirectly by the Corteza backend server.
Scripts are not jailed or virtualized and run in the same context as the main Corredor app.
This will probably be changed in the future to prevent scripts doing actions such as stopping the whole Corredor server

Make sure your scripts are audited and making changes where they should.
Last line of defense is (Docker) container, where the Corredor application is running.

## Client scripts (WIP)

Client scripts are bundled with all their dependencies and 'Corteza webapp boot loader' with Webpack.

This bundles (each Corteza frontend app has one bundle) is loaded alongside the Corteza web application by the user's browser.

Boot loader makes sure that all client scripts are properly registered in the event bus and executed in right order and in the right context

Make sure your scripts are audited and properly coded.

## Development & testing

Corredor uses YARN for package management.
If you insist on using npm, make sure correct package versions are installed (yarn uses `yarn.lock` to keep track of exact versions used).

 1. `yarn` to install dependencies
 2. `yarn serve:dev` to start the development server (restarts when files change)
 3. `yarn test:unit` to run all unit tests (add `--watch` watch files for changes and restart)

.Note on Corredor's `package.json`
You'll see majority of development dependencies under dependencies key.
This is intentional as we want to access certain packages in non-dev mode as well (bundling client scripts with webpack, Typescript compiling, running unit tests)

.Note on running the app and bundling Corredor's application code
We're doing some funky stuff, importing code on the fly and (by default) Webpack does not like that.
It transpiles loading logic (see `src/loader.ts`) in a way that it does not find the user scripts any more.
Until this problem is resolved, app code (`./src/**`) can not be compiled (ts => js) and properly bundled and application is ran via `ts-node` tool.


### Environmental variables

Corredor read `.env` file if exists and merges that with environmental variables.
See https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv[dotenv] package for details.

All possible configuration is covered in `src/config.ts` where all environmental variables are read and processed.

#### Settings for both, Corredor and API server
[cols="m,m,"]
|===
|Type|Default value|Description
3+| CORREDOR_ADDR
| string
| _depends on the environment_
| This setting is used by both, Corredor and API Server.

For Corredor server: address where it's gRPC server is listening on

For API server: where can Corredor server be accessed.

Note on default value and environment:

By default (as configured in the source code), Corredor and API listen/connect-to `localhost:50051`.
Docker images override these values with `localhost:80` and `corredor:80` so API can connect to Corredor in another container.
If you change names of your Docker services, this value needs to be changed.

3+| CORREDOR_LOG_ENABLED
| boolean
| corredor
| This setting is used by both, Corredor and API Server.

For Corredor service: where is service listening on (gRPC)

For API server: where can Corredor service be accessed.

3+| CORREDOR_LOG_LEVEL
| string
| info
| Defaults to `trace` when in development environment, defines amount of log information outputed.


|===


#### Corredor server

[cols="m,m,"]
|===

3+| CORREDOR_LOG_PRETTY
| boolean
| false
| Are events logged in one-line JSON or formatted to ease development?

3+| CORREDOR_ENVIRONMENT
|string|prod
|Set environment we're running in. This influences on other settings (see descriptions of other environmental variables).

If `CORREDOR_ENVIRONMENT` is not found, Corredorr looks for `CORREDOR_ENV` and `NODE_ENV` variables (in that order).

Recognised values are `/^prod.*/` and `/^dev.*/`.

In production:
 - server certificates are enabled (when not explicitly disabled by `CORREDOR_SERVER_CERTIFICATES_ENABLED=false`)
 - rich & pretty log output is disabled (when not explicitly enabled by `CORREDOR_LOG_PRETTY=true`)
 - log level is set to `INFO` (when not explicitly set with `CORREDOR_LOG_LEVEL` to trace, debug, info, warn, error)

3+| CORREDOR_CORTEZA_PROTOBUF_PATH

3+| CORREDOR_EXEC_CSERVERS_API_HOST
| string
| `public.crt`
| Where should Corredor connect to (on behalf of client scripts it is running)?

This is used in combination with `CORREDOR_EXEC_CSERVERS_API_BASEURL_TEMPLATE`.
If value is not found under `CORREDOR_EXEC_CSERVERS_API_HOST`, configuration tries to use `DOMAIN`, `HOSTNAME` and `HOST`.

When starting up Corredor, you can see how Base URLs are set for each service.

3+| CORREDOR_EXEC_CSERVERS_API_BASEURL_TEMPLATE
| string
| `https://api.{host}/{service}`
| Template to assemble base url for system, compose and messaging REST API (`CORREDOR_EXEC_CSERVERS_*\_API_BASEURL`).

Default value assumes corredor is running in monolith setup.
If you are running subsystems in separated services, you can set this to `https://api.{service}.{host}`.

When starting up Corredor, you can see how Base URLs are set for each service.

3+| CORREDOR_EXEC_CTX_CORTEZA_SERVERS_SYSTEM_API_BASEURL
| string
| (assembled from baseurl template)
